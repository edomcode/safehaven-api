# SafeHaven API

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-blue)

A secure and anonymous backend system designed to support users on their journey toward emotional healing, mental wellness, and spiritual growth.

## ‚ú® Project Vision
SafeHaven API is a privacy-first Django backend platform that empowers users‚Äîespecially students‚Äîfacing anxiety, depression, trauma, or emotional stress. Through tools like journaling, mood tracking, gratitude logging, and access to supportive therapists and community reflections, the system fosters:
    Emotional resilience
    Mindfulness and spiritual grounding
    Healing from childhood trauma
   Purpose discovery and personal growth
All interactions are anonymous, ensuring a safe space for reflection and healing.
Importantly, the platform also addresses non-suicidal emotional struggles‚Äîsuch as the pain of family divorce, childhood neglect, addiction, and identity confusion. These experiences often go unspoken, yet they deeply affect mental health and spiritual well-being.
